# ✍️ MindFlow: A Sentimental Journaling Platform
## Full-Stack Application for Mood Tracking and Data Visualization
Welcome to the repository for **MindFlow**, a full-stack application I am building from scratch to help users track their mental well-being through daily journaling and mood analysis.
This project is designed as an intensive **5-week sprint** to solidify my full-stack development skills using modern technologies and directly apply concepts learned during CS50x's Python and SQL modules. As a fully deployed, working application, this will be the capstone piece on my CV!

## ✨ Key Features & Skill Showcase
* **Daily Journaling:** Simple, clean UI built with **ReactJS** for capturing text and selecting a mood. This demonstrates front-end component architecture.
* **Secure Storage:** Entries are sent via a **REST API** to a **Python Flask backend** and securely stored in an **SQLite database**. This proves my ability to handle full-stack communication (CRUD).
* **Mood Visualization:** A dedicated dashboard displays mood trends over time using charting libraries, showcasing effective **data analysis and presentation**.
* **Real-World Relevance:** The project tackles a common problem in the highly relevant Health/Wellness tech domain.
